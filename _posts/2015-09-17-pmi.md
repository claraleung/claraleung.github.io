**A large scale effort for personalized medicine** 

<span class="firstcharacter">A</span> new era in medicine is approaching us where the [one-size-fits-all](http://synapse.ucsf.edu/articles/2015/02/18/%E2%80%98one-size-doesn%E2%80%99t-fit-all%E2%80%99-what-precision-medicine-holds-our-future) treatments will not be the norm. Genomic sequencing will become a standard part of the health care being delivered and chronic treatments will be individualized, accounting for genetic factors such as SNPs and levels of expression. 

In his 2015 State of the Union address, President Obama announced the *Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI)* – An exciting new research effort to accelerate our understanding of individual differences in people’s genes, environment, and lifestyle and their effect on disease onset, profession, prevention, and treatment. Soon afterward, the NIH Director, Dr. Francis Collins, established an expert Working Group to draft a plan for creating and managing the **PMI Cohort Program** (PMI-CP). Just today, the Committee presented their report to Dr. Collins. The report (available below) provides a detailed design framework for building a national research participant group, called a cohort, of 1 million or more Americans to expand our knowledge and practice of precision medicine. 

Dr. Collins tasked this group to develop a plan for creating and managing a large research cohort, with data and specimens that can be accessed by all researchers, for studies to understand the variables that contribute to health and disease, with the ultimate goal of developing more effective treatments tailored to individuals. The report drafted by the working group makes numerous recommendations on cohort assembly, participant engagement, data, biological specimens, policy and governance. The recommendations are based on a set of high-value scientific opportunities that were identified by the working group following extensive stakeholder engagement, including four public workshops and two requests for information. Among the scientific opportunities presented by this cohort is the ability to:
 
1. Develop quantitative estimates of risk for a range of diseases by integrating environmental exposures, genetic factors and gene-environment interactions;  
2. Identify the causes of individual variation in response to commonly used therapeutics (commonly referred to as pharmacogenomics);  
3. Discover biological markers that signal increased or decreased risk of developing common diseases;  
4. Use mobile health (mHealth) technologies to correlate activity, physiological measures and environmental exposures with health outcomes;  
5. Develop new disease classifications and relationships;  
6. Empower study participants with data and information to improve their own health; and  
7. Create a platform to enable trials of targeted therapies.

**Patient Volunteers:**

The report also proposes an innovative strategy to allow any person living in the United States to voluntarily enroll in the study directly or through participating healthcare provider organizations. Participants would volunteer to share core data including their electronic health records, health survey information and mobile health data on lifestyle habits and environmental exposures. They would also undergo a standard baseline exam for vital signs, medication assessment and past medical history and provide a blood sample. In return, participants will have access to their study results, along with aggregated results from all study participants, and will be provided with tools to make sense of the results. All of this will be accomplished with essential privacy and security safeguards. The Precision Medicine Initiative cohort would be a highly interactive research model with participants as partners in the development and implementation of the research and with significant representation in governance and oversight.

The entire report also talks in depth about the management of the cohort, data security policies, development of the infrastructure for such an effort. Only a summary of the program is presented above, I hope that in the next few days, I can go through the entire report and make a multiple post-series briefly explaining the whole plan.
